# Macropad Hotkeys

This is my personal fork of the excellent [Macropad Hotkeys example](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Learning_System_Guides/tree/main/Macropad_Hotkeys) from Adafruit.

Contains the contents of my personal macropad including macro's in development.  Also note that I'm a Mac user with a British keyboard layout by default so your mileage may vary.

For more information see the [MACROPAD Hotkeys Learning Guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/macropad-hotkeys)
